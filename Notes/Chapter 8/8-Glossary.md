# Chapter 8 Glossary

### Relational Algebra

The basic set of operations for the formal relational model. It is a procedural query language that specifies how to retrieve data from a database. They enable a user to specify basic retrieval requests.






### Tuple Relational Calculus

A form of relational calculus that uses a list of attribute names and a logical formula to specify the tuples in a relation that satisfy the formula. It focuses on what is retrieved, not how to retrieve it.


### Tuple Variable

A variable that usually ranges over a particular database relation. Commonly expressed as **{t | CONDITION(t)} **where t is the tuple variable and CONDITION is a logical formula that specifies the tuples to be retrieved.
